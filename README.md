# üí∞ Personal Finance Tracker

## üîñ Project Title & Description  
The **Personal Finance Tracker** is a web application designed to help individuals take control of their financial health. It enables users to:  
- Log incomes and expenses.  
- Categorize transactions (e.g., food, rent, entertainment).  
- Generate monthly/weekly spending reports.  
- Visualize financial habits with charts and summaries.  

**Why it matters:**  
Many people struggle with budgeting and keeping track of where their money goes. This tool provides **clarity and insights** into personal finance, making it easier to save, reduce unnecessary spending, and plan for the future.

## üß† AI Integration Strategy  

AI will be integrated into **three main aspects** of the project:  

### 1. Code Generation  
- **Scaffolding**: Use AI-powered tools (e.g., VSCode AI, CLI agents) to generate boilerplate code for models, routes, and React components.  
- **Feature Implementation**: Prompt AI with file trees or specs to auto-generate controllers, services, and frontend forms for transactions.  

### 2. Testing  
- **Unit Tests**: Generate Jest unit tests for service functions (e.g., calculating total monthly expenses).  
- **Integration Tests**: Use AI to draft test cases covering API endpoints and database queries.  

### 3. Documentation  
- **Docstrings & Comments**: Generate inline comments for complex logic (e.g., transaction categorization).  
- **README & Project Docs**: Use AI to draft, update, and maintain project documentation.  

### 4. Context-Aware Techniques  
- **File Trees**: Provide AI with the project structure to help generate consistent code across frontend and backend.  
- **Diffs**: Use git diffs as AI input for generating changelogs and PR descriptions.  
- **API Specs**: Feed OpenAPI/Swagger definitions into AI to scaffold frontend API calls and TypeScript interfaces.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements  
- Export reports to PDF/Excel.  
- AI-powered spending insights (e.g., ‚ÄúYou spent 20% more on dining this month compared to last.‚Äù).  
- Mobile-friendly PWA version.

## üì§ Deliverable  
This README is the initial **project plan**. The codebase and documentation will evolve iteratively, leveraging AI tools throughout the development cycle.
